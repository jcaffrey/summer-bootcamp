## Final Project
### Purpose
Use advanced **machine learning** algorithms, through the nltk library to find an application of sentiment analysis
### Resources
[Intro to nltk/python](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html)
### How to use the example code
In the skeleton/ dir, we have provided a skeleton outline for what student's code could look like.  Use the sample project to give inspiration for students to persue projects of their own, as well as to guide them in producing their projects
